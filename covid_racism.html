            <p class="main_text" style="">In their critique of racial formation theory, Feagin and Elias (2013) describe the "dominant white frame" as "created to rationalize and buttress the oppressive hierarchy and related societal structures of systemic racism." Today, as we live through a global pandemic that has and will continue to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, it is impossible to understand media coverage of the crisis outside of this framework. In article after article, headline after headline, news organizations depict the connections between racism and Covid-19 within a white racial frame that ignores the racist insitutions and systems that existed before this crisis appeared.</p>

            <p class="main_text" style="">This project aims to reframe discussions about racism and Covid-19 by showing how four aspects of the conversation - underlying health conditions, economic inequality, access to public and private space, and racial data - can be best understood with guidance from critical race theorists. While some news organizations have rightly noted that we should not discuss race and coronavirus without contextualizing it in the history of white supremacy and institutional racism, we believe this broader reframing is necessary.</p>

            <h2 class="subheader">Underlying health conditions</h2>

            <p class="main_text" style="">COVID-19’s spread across the United States poses a serious health risk to everyone in the country. However, some are more likely to contract the virus than others and many are more likely to die due to its complications. While there are many factors that put an individual at greater risk of suffering from the disease, the presence of comorbidities is one of the powerful indicators of COVID-19 related complications that significantly increases the chance of death. As of April 8th, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/4/8/21207269/covid-19-coronavirus-risk-factors" target="_blank">78% of all people</a> who entered into intensive care for coronavirus in the US have had an underlying condition: 32% had diabetes, 29% had heart disease and 21% had chronic lung disease. These diseases cause the most complications when comorbid with coronavirus.</p>
<p class="main_text" style="">These diseases are also disproportionately found among black communities. <a href="https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=18" target="_blank">According to the US Department of Health and Human Services</a>, “African American adults are 60% more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to have been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician”. They also found <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/race-and-blame/609946/" target="_blank">increased rates</a> of high cholesterol, hypertension, and heart disease among black patients, statistics that some have attributed to African Americans themselves. The reason for this difference is not explained by a natural propensity of blacks to eat foods with more carbs and sugars, but by a myriad of explanations that result from institutional structures. Low socio-economic status and low educational level are two factors that may lie at the heart of explaining these data. At the end of the day, black Americans are more likely than white Americans to face serious health problems as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<p class="main_text" style="">The disproportionate effect of coronavirus on the black community as a result of comorbidities can be seen in the lopsided death count. While there are few states publishing data on race and ethnicity among those that they treat, the states that have shown these data reveal astonishing racial discrepancies.</p>
In Chicago, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200420-coronavirus-why-some-racial-groups-are-more-vulnerable" target="_blank">reported in early April</a>, 72% of people who died of coronavirus were black, even though blacks only make up one third of the city’s population. Among them, the majority had underlying health conditions. In fact, 81% of them had “hypertension, or high blood pressure, diabetes or both”. These comorbidities are both the most dangerous to coronavirus patients as well as some of the <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/in-chicago-70-of-covid-19-deaths-are-black/dd3f295f-445e-4e38-b37f-a1503782b507" target="_blank">most prevalent diseases within the black community</a>. In Georgia, the racial disparity is similar: White people account for 58% of the population but only represent 40% of confirmed cases, as of April 17th. In Michigan, African Americans account for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52194018" target="_blank">33% of cases and 41% of all deaths</a> despite representing only 14% of the state’s population. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/early-data-shows-african-americans-have-contracted-and-died-of-coronavirus-at-an-alarming-rate" target="_blank">Wisconsin</a>, where the life expectancy of African Americans is 14 years shorter than that of whites, has seen black Milwaukee residents make up half of the city’s confirmed cases and 81% of its deaths. Blacks represent 26% of the city’s population.</p>

<p class="main_text" style="">The pattern is similar in every major city and state that has tracked the racial breakdown of those infected with the virus, revealing a shocking disparity in deaths between black and non-black Americans. Since there is still very little known about the virus and the path of its spread, some may argue that the lopsided number of deaths between races is not due to the comorbidities that African Americans disproportionately suffer from. While no data draw a proven link, we believe the correlational evidence is strong enough to suggest a connection. At the very least, this matter needs to be investigated further.</p>
<p class="main_text" style="">Beyond being more prone to experiencing coronavirus more severely due to comorbidities, African Americans also face barriers in the healthcare system that disadvantages them from receiving equitable treatment. Tressie McMillan Cottom addresses the issue of racial biases in the health care system through a personal, heart-wrenching story of her visit to the hospital as she was in labor. Despite being in labor for three days and pleading with doctors for hospital admission throughout, her words were not taken seriously and she was even scolded for “not letting them know sooner”, after it was eventually discovered she had two tumors in her womb alongside her baby. Her daughter died shortly after birth. Like millions of women of color, she says, “the healthcare machine could not imagine me as competent and so it neglected and ignored me until I was incompetent.” She asserts that racial biases embedded in the health system result in disparate outcomes.</p>
<p class="main_text" style="">The World Health Organization estimates that black expectant and new mothers in the United States die at the same rate as women in developing nations like Mexico and Uzbekistan. Black women in the United States die of pregnancy related causes at a much higher rate than white women in the US. Black babies, too, are more likely to die within two years of birth than white babies. Why do these discrepancies exist? Cottom recognizes that examples of racialized impressions of competence abound in the bureaucratic system that controls health care services. Even though many other facets of her life could have given the impression of competence, such as her educational background, manner of speech, ownership of health insurance, wealth, etc., her blackness overcame every other aspect of her identity.</p>
<p class="main_text" style="">There is significant research that supports Cottom’s work. The “racial empathy gap” is a phenomenon that has been raised by various authors and researchers as they attempt to understand racial biases in the American healthcare system. Rashawn Ray has found that black patients are, on average, <a href="http://rashawnray.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Place-to-Trust_Sewell-and-Ray.pdf" target="_blank">talked to more than listened to</a>. US surveys have found that medical staff are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25032386" target="_blank">more uncertain</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738399115300252?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">less communicative</a> with non-white patients than white patients. Additionally, black patients may be half as likely to receive pain medication as white patients. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment" target="_blank">Cottom was refused</a> sufficient doses of morphine to combat her extreme pain and discomfort after she was admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p class="main_text" style="">So, why is Cottom’s story important? Research linking racial biases felt by COVID-19 patients has not yet been conducted, but the literature clearly suggests biases may be at play in the hospitals that are currently treating these patients. We have strong evidence to support that people of color are not treated equitably in the health care system, which may be a powerful contributing factor in higher rates of deaths among women in labor and newborn babies. Could these racial biases be playing a role in the immense disparity in the death rate between black and white COVID-19 patients in Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the rest of the country? It is unlikely the current pandemic would allow us a reprieve from the racial discrimination that affects millions of black men and women in the United States every year. It is not only the tangible, easily-observed factors like comorbidities that increase any given black individual’s chance of death during the pandemic, but also the subtle, hard-to-detect biases that control the way black patients are treated.</p>

            <h2 class="subheader">Racial data</h2>

            <p class="main_text" style="">“Without racial data, we can’t see whether there are disparities between the races in coronavirus testing, infection, and death rates. If we can’t see racial disparities, then we can’t see the racist policies behind any disparities and deaths. If we can’t see racist policies, we can’t eliminate racist policies, or replace them with anti-racist policies that protect equity and life.” -Ibram X. Kendi (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-looking-away-race-covid-19-victims/609250/)

As Kendi notes, racial data is a necessary step toward closing the racial disparities in Covid-19 infections and deaths. But as of 14 April 2020, the CDC reported that only 22% of Covid-19 cases reported in the US specified the race of the patient. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html). The Covid-19 Tracking Project has begun an initiative to both gather this data and understand which places in the country have released this information. We have collected this data as April 30. Use the interactive map below to see which states have released racial breakdowns in cases and deaths. Click on a state to view more detailed information.</p>
