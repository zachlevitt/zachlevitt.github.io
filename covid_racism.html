            <p class="main_text" style=""><!--From the moment Madonna tweeted that the Covid-19 crisis would be a "great equalizer," dominant media narratives have mirrored this vantage point.--> In their critique of racial formation theory, Feagin and Elias (2013) describe the "dominant white frame" as "created to rationalize and buttress the oppressive hierarchy and related societal structures of systemic racism." Today, as we live through a global pandemic that has and will continue to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, it is impossible to understand media coverage of the crisis outside of this framework. In article after article, headline after headline, news organizations depict the connections between racism and Covid-19 within a white racial frame that ignores the racist insitutions and systems that existed before this crisis appeared.</p>

            <p class="main_text" style="">This project aims to reframe discussions about racism and Covid-19 by showing how four aspects of the conversation - underlying health conditions, economic inequality, access to public and private space, and racial data - can be best understood with guidance from critical race theorists. While some news organizations have rightly noted that we should not discuss race and coronavirus without contextualizing it in the history of white supremacy and institutional racism, we believe this broader reframing is necessary.</p>
