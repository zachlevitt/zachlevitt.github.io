But ... how would such a feat be accomplished? What mysterious force or mind altering substance could compel an entire population into such total social integration without them even noticing it happening, or uttering the tiniest peep of protest?"</p>
        <p class="desc" style="max-width:500px;margin-top:10px;font-size:14px;text-indent:2em;">Laura Kipnis in <i>Against Love</i></p>

                <p class="desc">
                    In her polemic, <i>Against Love</i>, Laura Kipnis argues that coupledom is a mechanism of social control that relies upon the labor of love. Advocating for a rethinking of the source of our societal taboo on non-monogamy, Kipnis views American's idolization of marriage as the sole vehicle of love as dangerously intertwined with capitalism. Throughout diverse media, dominant narratives about love and marriage reinforce our view of love as monogamous, committed and worthy of <i>work</i>. Just as the American psyche has been molded to believe that work creates happiness and worth, most of us believe that work creates love. In this project, we reflect on Kipnis' piece and distill important concepts that we took away from class and other authors for an audience that has not taken Sociology of Heterosexuality. At the end, you will find an interactive map that tries to put into practice some of these abstract ideas.</p>

                    <p class="desc"><b>1. Love is a hegemonic ideology.</b><br><br>
                    We are a society that obsesses over rationality and logic. Yet, “love at first sight” and many other enchanted versions of love are a ubiquitous concept. We are taught to obsess over love, and if we don’t, there must be something wrong with us. This creates a lot of anxiety and pressure to constantly search for the perfect person to fall in love with. Our project puts this anxiety front and center by offering a solution to this anxiety: visit our website! By seeing its potential personal utility and also its similarities to online dating apps, we hope our project brings to light how much time, energy, and money are focused on love in our daily lives. Also, we hope people will critically ask themselves why is love such a ubiquitous concept? And who is excluded in its ideology?</p>
                    <p class="desc"><b>2. The heterosexual was invented. Monogamy or coupledom are not natural or inevitable.</b><br><br>Marriage promotion is a government strategy that encourages pro-creation and social control. It’s in its best interest to promote a discourse that makes monogamy or coupledom seem natural or just how “things are.” And anyone who does not have these tendencies are deviants who need to be changed. The U.S. government has a long history of systemically excluding those who did not identify as heterosexuals from society. In the early 1900s, this entailed disallowing immigrants from entering the U.S. because they showed some trait that did not adhere to the heterosexual norm. After World War II, this entailed excluding non-hetrosexuals from getting GI bill benefits.  Also, beginning in the 1940s, policymakers made it easier for people who identified as heterosexual to acquire mortgaes while simultaneously exclsuding sexual deviants from the suburban housing market. During the 1960s, city leaders incentivized heterosexual couples to move to suburban areas which reinforcing the notation that heterosexual norms were universal by creating areas that were almost exclusively heterosexual. These are just a couple of examples of how the government has used their power to make a world that prioritizes the heterosexual while punishing any who deviant from this norm. However, the heterosexual was actually invented in 1869.Check out these works to learn more about heterosexualities invention, social construction, and prioritization in society:<br><ul>

<p class="desc"><b>3. We are taught to obsess about heterosexual love at a young age.</b><br><br>At a young age, pop culture and the media teach us the importance of finding “the one” to spend the rest of our lives with. Disney’s success is predicated on a formula that consists of romance, finding true love, and getting married. The production of heterosexuality in Disney classics like The Little Mermaid, Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty is front and center. The films prescribe a certain enactment of masculinity and femininity. They make us desire marriage and its embedded class privilege.  Moreover, rituals like the Prom or getting on one knee to propose further instill gender roles and heterosexuality into our lives. Check out these pieces to learn more:<br>

<p class='desc'><b>4. Companies work to perpetuate hegemonic ideas of love in order to sell us things.</b><br><br>Did you know diamonds aren’t actually rare? And that the same company that made you think they were rare by controlling supply and demand is the same company that started an ad campaign that invented the diamond engagement ring? Consumption has become an important way to show love. Advertisements constantly sell us products that help us with love. Furthermore, weddings are seen as vital ceremonies that are prerequisites for love, no matter their cost. Not to mention the “standard”  promposals – the act of asking someone to the prom– are becoming more and more lavish. Companies and corporations benefit from these uncompromising and unconditional rituals, and they have a vested interest in perpetuating and normalizing them.

<p class="desc">The fact that our project is free is an attempt to reject the notion that consumption and intimacy are inextricably tied and contingent. Our project attempts to raise awareness of the presence of capitalism in the bedroom by including whether or not you are searching for individuals who are employed or unemployed. Also, users do not have to pay to use the website, and we do not make any money from it.</p>


<p class="desc"><b>3. “Time is money” is a popular idiom for a reason. No wonder more and more people are turning towards dating apps to find love.</b><br><br>
Neo-liberalism and capitalism encourage people to be more efficient and productive so that they have more time to be efficient and productive. Herein lies just one intersection of capitalism and love.  The proliferation of dating apps is a symptom of capitalism expanding into the realm of intimacy. Now, people can be more efficient than ever with finding love. People no longer have to waste time trying to find the right person to love. Now, all this can be done with a simple swipe of your finger. Not only do apps like Grindr and Tinder encourage your love-making or finding to be efficient and productive but they also encourage us to commodify ourselves. Dating app profiles encourage self-branding. And if someone doesn’t like what you’re selling, you can just hop back on the marketplace to find more buyers.

<p class="desc">Our website does not show you where exactly the people you are looking for are (in large part because of privacy and data issues, but regardless….). Instead of trying to streamline the process of finding love, our website encourages people to spend (not waste) the time to go out and find the people they are looking for. In setting up a potentially time consuming process, we hope to dismiss the importance of efficiency and productivity in the search for intimacy. Use the map below to search for any address in New York City and explore the geography of marriage in your neighborhood. The map will identify the populations living within roughly 1.5 kilometers (easy walking distance) from your location. Next, you can enter your preferences for sex identity, employment status, and marital status to see how many potential suitors live close to you. Unfortunately census data on gender only includes these two genders. However, in allowing people to choose between male and female, we hope our project denaturalizes heterosexuality and encourages our users to conceptualize love beyond a heterosexual institution. We hope this tool is one small step toward making society more open about sexuality and encouraging rather than repressing our natural inclinations toward love, in all its forms.</p>
