For our project, we researched and mapped the history of environmental and political injustice on the Blackfeet reservation and their sacred lands in Montana near Glacier National Park. Click <a href="./files/02_Blackfeet_Nation_History.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> or on the image to see a higher resolution version of this layout.</p><p class="card-text">One aspect of our research explored the history of the Blackfeet reservation from 1800 to 1895, in particular the actions of the American and Canadian governments to drastically reduce their homeland through false treaties and intimidation. In addition, we researched the modern day environmental struggles to ban oil and gas leasing on the Badger-Two Medicine, which has been in place since the 1980s. We also examined the meaning and uses of mountain cartography and whether it can be used to enhance our understanding of issues of injustice.</p>

The goal of the project was to represent and describe the impact of the Dakota Access Pipeline on drinking water sources and tribal lands in North Dakota. This map was created while the protests at Standing Rock were ongoing, and it was when I heard that the pipeline construction had completed and oil was already flowing that I decided to complete the layout with up-to-date information. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Worked with fellow Software Development students to develop Midd Music, a Middlebury-specific platform to connect student musicians with music fans on campus. The web application allows Middlebury musicians to login with the Google API, create and edit their profile, create and edit events, and publicize their information to students. While it has not been deployed to the college community yet, there are a combination of fake and real profiles/events shown on the site. The application was built using React.js and Node.js over the second half of our semester.</p>
                <p class="card-text">My role in this project was multi-faceted. I led the overall design of the site and implemented many of the key functionalities, such as the calendar views on the home page, the featured artist sidebar, the search bar, the ability to create/edit/delete profiles and create/edit/delete events, as well as integration of the UI with the server.

                <p class="card-text">One of the projects I worked on during my fellowship with VRDI was analyzing the phenomenon of prison gerrymandering in North Carolina. Prison gerrymandering is a term for the ways that the Census Bureau's population-counting rules disenfranchise incarcerated people and lead to vote distortion. For more information on prison gerrymandering, I would encourage you to visit the Prison Policy Initiative's <a href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/impact.html" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
                <p class="card-text">These maps examine the racial geography of incarceration in North Carolina and which counties benefit from the Census Bureau's prison counting rules. Vote inflation refers to a situation in which the incarcerated population is counted as part of the eligible voting population yet are not allowed to vote, leading to inflated influence for voters in these areas. Most often, this phenomenon occurs in rural, white areas where prisons tend to be located. In these cases, rural, white populations are over-represented due to the disenfranchisement of people of color.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Researched environmental injustice in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Houston. For this project, I analyzed whether certain demographic groups were more likely to live close to toxic sites before the hurricane, and whether damage caused by it disproportionately impacted these same populations. Since I completed the project only months after the disaster, data collection proved difficult and flood inundation areas were still preliminary. Therefore, I ended up looking at the large concentration of toxic sites in Harris County and using damage to these sites as a proxy for damage from the hurricane. This project represents a semester of work and learning about using GIS analysis and techniques to deconstruct and understand environmental issues. Please click on the image to view at full-size.
