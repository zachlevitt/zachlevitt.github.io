But ... how would such a feat be accomplished? What mysterious force or mind altering substance could compel an entire population into such total social integration without them even noticing it happening, or uttering the tiniest peep of protest?"</p>
        <p class="desc" style="max-width:500px;margin-top:10px;font-size:14px;text-indent:2em;">Laura Kipnis in <i>Against Love</i></p>

                <p class="desc">
                    In her polemic, <i>Against Love</i>, Laura Kipnis argues that coupledom is a mechanism of social control that relies upon the labor of love. Advocating for a rethinking of the source of our societal taboo on non-monogamy, Kipnis views American's idolization of marriage as the sole vehicle of love as dangerously intertwined with capitalism. Throughout diverse media, dominant narratives about love and marriage reinforce our view of love as monogamous, committed and worthy of <i>work</i>. Just as the American psyche has been molded to believe that work creates happiness and worth, most of us believe that work creates love.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Where is the resistance? Dating apps. If we are looking for ease of imagining life without the constraints of lifelong marriage, reproduction, and the “work of marriage,” look no further than Tinder, Bumble or Grindr.</p>

            <p class="desc">There are roughly 30,000 miles of faults cutting across California, but the three fault sections that most concern many seismologists are the San Andreas, San Jacinto and Hayward. As they continue to build up seismic stress, ruptures become more and more likely. These faults are located near the Bay Area and Los Angeles, and could potentially displace millions of people. </p>
